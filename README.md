# Video-to-text-conversion-and-summarization

Hi folks, Here i have presented my web application on conversion of youtube video to text summarization using python
I have used the google speech to text module for conversion here, But initially i have used one of the gpt3 module called "Whisper"
For some technical issues i couldn't use it for my web app and for text summarization i have used the nltk module.
Hope you like it
